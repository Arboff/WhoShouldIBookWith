This was a side project I decided to do so I can lay my foundations into **JavaScript** and polish a bit my **CSS** and **HTML**.

# ** WHAT DOES IT DO ? **

The main idea is (If you've ever worked in the freight industry on the teritory of the USA) that it takes a broker from the top 100 brokers for 2021 (List compiled by https://www.freightforwarderservices.com/) and suggests to you, which one should you use on your next truck.
*Don't do it, they will cancel you last minute eitherway.*

# Main Concept

1. Based on Structure of HTML>CSS>JS.
2. Currently its pretty Jank and uses mostly solid images for its functionality instead of CSS coded ones.
3. JS is currently only being used to retreive a random image from /images and display it. See Bellow.

>unction get_random_image(){
>  random_index = Math.floor(Math.random() * image_array.length);
>
>  select_image = image_array[random_index]
>
> document.getElementById('image_shower').src = `./images/${select_image}`
>}

## Will add more JS functionality, like animations and smoother workflow of website.
## Might re-write it in Flask, someday...
